//      "About Me: Hey I'm Adam. I 31 years old and have lived in Portland, Oregon most of my life. I gave up my job as a mechanic to go back to school to become a developer(open ended I know, but I'm still figuring it out). My recent job history I hesitated to share. I wasn't sure it was applicable to what my long term goals are. After some more thought, that has changed. "
