                Bio:
            </legend>
            <p class="intro"> Danza was born in Brooklyn, New York,[1] to parents Anna Mary (née Camisa; 1925–1993) 
            and Matthew Anthony "Matty" Iadanza (1920–1983). His mother was a bookkeeper and his father worked as a waste collector in Brooklyn.
            Danza's paternal grandparents were from Pietrelcina, Benevento, Campania, Italy, and his mother was an immigrant from the town of Campobello di Mazara in the Sicilian province of Trapani.
            Shortly after his college graduation from the University of Dubuque, Danza was discovered by a producer at a boxing gymnasium in New York. 
            He then earned a spot on the television show Taxi, playing a cab driver and part-time boxer Tony Banta, 
            and later starred on Who's the Boss?, in which he portrayed Tony Micelli, a former baseball player, housekeeper, and single father.
            For his contribution to the television industry, in 1988, Danza was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.
