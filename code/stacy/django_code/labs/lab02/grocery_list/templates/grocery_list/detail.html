    {% comment %} Let's create a simple grocery list app.
This can be done with a single app called grocery_list and model called GroceryItem which contains a text description, a created date, a completed date, and a boolean representing whether it was completed.

The user should be presented with an input field and a button (in a form). When the clicks the button, it should save the data to the server and show the newly-added item in the list. The user should be presented with a list of incomplete items and a list of complete items. THe user should be able to mark an item complete/incomplete and be able to delete an item. {% endcomment %}
