## **Project Overview**

I'm a big fan of youtube and how you can interact and talk to random people about any video you like to watch right then and there. Sometimes when I'm watching a TV show and something cool or crazy happens during the show I often find myself pulling out my phone to leave a comment like if I were watching a youtube video. So why not make something were I have the ability to comment on that specific episode and/or read other peoples thoughts on it.
