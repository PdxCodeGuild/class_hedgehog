            The demon core was a spherical 6.2-kilogram (14 lb) subcritical mass of plutonium 89 millimetres (3.5 in) in diameter, manufactured during World War II by the United States nuclear weapon development effort, the Manhattan Project, as a fissile core for an early atomic bomb. It was involved in two criticality accidents, on August 21, 1945, and May 21, 1946, each of which resulted in a fatality. The core was intended for use in a possible third nuclear weapon destined for Japan, but when Japan surrendered, making it unnecessary, it was repurposed for testing. As a result of two separate criticality experiments performed at the Los Alamos Laboratory, in an attempt show that the core was close to criticality, the device was accidently placed into a supercritical configuration. As a result, scientists Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin, suffered acute radiation poisoning and died soon after.
