		<h1>Hedgehog</h1>
		<hr />
		<p class="intro">
			A hedgehog is a spiny mammal of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the
			eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are seventeen species of hedgehog
			in five genera found throughout parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in
			New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia
			and no living species native to the Americas. However, the extinct genus
			Amphechinus was once present in North America. Hedgehogs share distant
			ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the
			intermediate link, and they have changed little over the last fifteen
			million years.[2] Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a
			nocturnal way of life.[3] Their spiny protection resembles that of
			porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.
