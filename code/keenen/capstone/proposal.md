# Pilot's Examiner Planner 

## Intro 

As a pilot trains and moves through the ranks, honing in their skills and earning new ratings and certificates, they must navigate the difficult process of locating and scheduling an FAA Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) to start the initial process when applying for an FAA checkride. This process currently proves to be very cumbersome and often takes a very long time to receive a response in reagrd to scheduling as the only communication is via email and/or phone, which often leads to unreturned voicemails and/or messages. 

## Project Overview

Pilot's Examiner Planner (PEP) aims to make this process much more ergonomic as a 'one-stop-shop,' user-friendly interface that allows users to locate examiners based on specific criteria chosen by the user (ie. location, examiner/designee type, authorizations, name, phone, email, etc.). Examiners will also be able to integrate their availability via calendar functionality to allow the user to see when the examiner will be availble next. Both the user, and examiner, will be able to communicate internally amongst one another to eliminate the need for pesky phone calls and voice mails; we'll keep those as a last resort. 

## Functionality

- Create account, login, view user profile (pilot and examiner)
