            The Pilot's Examiner Planner (PEP) app is a one-stop-shop for a
            pilot that is seeking a checkride from an FAA Designated Pilot
            Examiner (DPE). As a pilot trains and moves through the ranks,
            honing in their skills while earning new ratings and certificates,
            they must navigate the difficult process of locating and scheduling
            a DPE to start the initial process when applying for an FAA
            checkride. This process currently proves to be very cumbersome and
            often takes an unneccesary amount of time to receive a response
            regarding scheduling, as the only communication is via email and/or
            phone, which often leads to un-returned voicemails and/or messages.

            <h2>The Why</h2>
            <hr width="15%" />
            <p>
              Throughout my aviation journey, I've always noticed that when
              trying to schedule a checkride, or even just getting in touch with
              a DPE to do so, it has really been a struggle. Usually, once your
              flight instructor deems that you are checkride-ready, they're the
              ones that try to schedule your checkride for you. That being said,
              flight instructors are, often, very busy. They have multiple
              students that are in different phases of their flight training and
              most are seeking different licenses (PPL, instrument, commercial,
              comm/multi, etc.). You can probably tell how that might become
              overwhelming for one person. Then there's also the difficulty when
              it comes to trying to find a DPE that is available within the near
              future, and that's if your flight instructor can even get ahold of
              them. With the PEP app, a lot of that stress can be taken off of
              the flight instructor and the responisbility of scheduling can be
              placed upon the applicant pilot.

              Pilot's Examiner Planner aims to make this process much more
              ergonomic as a 'one-stop-shop,' user-friendly interface that
              allows users (pilot applicants) to locate examiners based on
              specific criteria chosen by the user (ie. location,
              examiner/designee type, authorizations, name, phone, email, etc.).
              Examiners will also be able to integrate their availability via
              calendar functionality to allow the user to see when the examiner
              will be available next. Both, the user and examiner, will be able
              to communicate internally, amongst one another, to eliminate the
              need for pesky phone calls and emails; we'll keep those as a last
              resort. Pilots will also be able to post, on a blog-type page,
              where they are located, who they used as their DPE, pass/fail,
              general expectation of requirements specific to the DPE that they
              used, and the cost of that DPE (prices range anywhere from
              $500-$1500 on average and depending on what type of checkride you
              are doing (instructor ratings are generally more expensive and
              take ~6-8 hours on average)).
